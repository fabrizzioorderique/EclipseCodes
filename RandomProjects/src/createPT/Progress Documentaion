	Right off the back I faced a problem: How I get user input from a selection of choices?
	In this case I just want the user to select the difficulty of the board: easy, medium, or hard.
	SOLUTION: I found that importing javax.swing.JComboBox allows me to do just that
		boolean problemSolved = true;
		
	12:00pm
	JComboBox has proven to take a bit more time to set up than I expected. I had to end up importing
	all javax.swing, javax.awt, and javax.awt.event. I learned that these components help developers 
	build Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Had to learn a variety of methods and look at examples 
	from Oracle in order to get the whole thing set up.
	
	12:30pm
	Decided to add a text label to give the user feedback when they select a difficulty. This wasn't
	to difficult but I didn't know how to do it so I had to look up the methods for it. Found out
	that I just needed to create a JLabel for it and that was all.
