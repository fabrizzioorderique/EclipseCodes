	Right off the back I faced a problem: How I get user input from a selection of choices?
	In this case I just want the user to select the difficulty of the board: easy, medium, or hard.
	SOLUTION: I found that importing javax.swing.JComboBox allows me to do just that
		boolean problemSolved = true;
		
	12:00pm
	JComboBox has proven to take a bit more time to set up than I expected. I had to end up importing
	all javax.swing, javax.awt, and javax.awt.event. I learned that these components help developers 
	build Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Had to learn a variety of methods and look at examples 
	from Oracle in order to get the whole thing set up.
	
	12:30pm
	Decided to add a text label to give the user feedback when they select a difficulty. This wasn't
	to difficult but I didn't know how to do it so I had to look up the methods for it. Found out
	that I just needed to create a JLabel for it and that was all. 
	
	6:30pm 
	I worked on the problems with the HaveUserSolveIt method. I decided to stop trying to use two 
	classes and instead have all the heavy lifting occurring in the actionPerformed method rather than 
	the main method.While using the while loop, I originally had a the user type in "quit" if they 
	wanted to exit the program and then have a boolean change if that string ever equaled "quit", or 
	if there were no more empty cells left to fill. I found that it would be a lot cleaner to just use 
	break; and that will exit the while loop.
