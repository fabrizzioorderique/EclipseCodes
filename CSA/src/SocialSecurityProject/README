README

This project is for my AP Computer Science A class. 
It is meant to be able to read a file downloaded from 
the Social Security website that contains a list of 
names and their ranks (based on how popular they were 
in that year, with the years ranging from 1900 to 2000. 

NOTES:

left to add: 
Add exception handling where appropriate. 
(Identify at least one exception other than the
file issue that you can handle with try and catch.)
